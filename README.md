🧠 Rubik’s Cube Solver – Programming Task Demo
Welcome to my Rubik’s Cube Solver challenge!
This project showcases a basic object-oriented simulation of a Rubik’s Cube, developed in JavaScript. The solution demonstrates my ability to design logical structures, handle cube face rotations manually, and build a working (even if not optimal) solver algorithm from scratch.

✅ Features:

Object-oriented cube representation

Manual side rotation functionality

Scrambling mechanism to generate a randomized cube

Basic solving algorithm (not optimized) that finds a valid solution

Step-by-step solution rendering using getCubeSvg() for easy visualization

⚙️ Goal: Focus on functionality and logic—not design or optimal solving. This is a pure logic-based implementation to demonstrate programming and problem-solving capabilities under real-world constraints.

🔁 Note: The solving steps and cube states are rendered live, so you can follow each move visually.
